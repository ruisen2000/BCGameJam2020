BC Game Jam (Weekend hackathon) 2020

Team: Trash Panda

A co-op ice climbing game where both players are tied to ech other!
Use rope mechanics to help swing your partner back up if they fall, to avoid being dragged off with them!

Big thanks to everyone who voted for us and helped us get second place for audience votes!
